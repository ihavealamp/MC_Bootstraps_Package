{"name":"Bootstraps - Mission Package Series","tagline":"Mission Controller Extended Add-on for Kerbal Space Program","body":"### Project Description\r\nThis is a project to create a series of mission packages for the Mission Controller Extended (MC) mod in conjunction with Kerbal Space Program (KSP). The goal is to provide a pathway for new players to learn the game in a fashion similar to how real life space programs developed. Much of the inspiration for this project came from the NASA and Soviet programs, condensing things where I felt necessary and providing a clean flow.\r\n\r\nThe initial scope is two-fold - programs within Kerbal's sphere of influence (Kerbal SOI.mpkg) and interplanetary programs (Interplanetary.mpkg).\r\n\r\n### Current Packages\r\nCurrent Packages:\r\n\r\n* [Kerbal SOI](https://github.com/ihavealamp/MC_Bootstraps_Package/wiki/Kerbal-SOI)\r\n* [Interplanetary](https://github.com/ihavealamp/MC_Bootstraps_Package/wiki/Interplanetary)\r\n\r\nWIP Packages:\r\n\r\n* Orbital Infrastructure\r\n\r\nProspective Packages:\r\n\r\n* Interlunatary\r\n* K-Plane\r\n* Reusable Launch Platform\r\n* Surface Infrastructure\r\n* Mining Operations\r\n* Survival Mode\r\n\r\n### Roadmap/Schedule\r\nShort-Term Focus:\r\n\r\n* Test basic functionality for all missions\r\n* Add basic descriptions for all goals\r\n\r\nMid-Term Focus:\r\n\r\n* Add full descriptions for all missions and goals\r\n* Build additional mission packages\r\n\r\nLong-Term Focus:\r\n\r\n* Gather feedback on mission rewards and fine-tune\r\n* Transition mission rewards from mission completion to goal completion\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nPlease feel free to submit any [issues, bugs or enhancement requests here](https://github.com/ihavealamp/MC_Bootstraps_Package/issues/new).
