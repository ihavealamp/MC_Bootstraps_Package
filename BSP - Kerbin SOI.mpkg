	name = Bootstraps - Kerbin Sphere of Influence (SOI) Mission Package
	description = This mission package focuses on programs within Kerbin's sphere of influence. The target audience is new players just learning the game and completionists who want to start from the beginning.\n\n IMPORTANT:\n\nThe initial Kerra program missions are extremely important to complete, as they both set the player up with start-up capital to get underway immediately, along with a short-term (one month only!) source of regular income to keep them going. Once you progress into the Katurn program, the immediate payouts will decrease significantly. After the Katurn program - and heading into all other missions, across all Bootstraps mission packages - there are no immediate payouts, only a time-limited daily income.\n\nPlayers *must* keep this in mind as they progress through their career as, in the long term, they'll have to maintain a stable income/budget... or risk going bankrupt and closing shop. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
