Project: Bootstraps - Mission Controller, Mission Package Series
Author: Anthony Pendleton (apendleton AT gmail DOT com)

-------------------------------------------------------

This is a project to create a series of mission packages for the Mission Controller Extended (MC) mod in conjunction with Kerbal Space Program (KSP). The goal is to provide a pathway for new players to learn the game in a fashion similar to how real life space programs developed. Much of the inspiration for this project came from the NASA and Soviet programs, condensing things where I felt necessary and providing a clean flow.

The initial scope is two-fold - programs within Kerbal's sphere of influence (Kerbal SOI.mpkg) and interplanetary programs (Interplanetary.mpkg). Including a high level overview of the programs within each package below:

Kerbal SOI, 34 missions

-Kercury, 4 missions (Basic launching, orbiting and landing)
-Kemini, 7 missions (Orbiting, EVA, rendezvous and docking)
-Kastor, 4 missions (Unmanned Mun orbiting, landing and returning)
-Kollux, 4 missions (Unmanned Minmus orbiting, landing and returning)
-Kapollo, 8 missions (Manned Mun orbiting, landing and returning)
-Kartemis, 7 missions (Manned Minmus orbiting, landing and returning)

Interplanetary, 34 missions

-Kares, 6 missions (Unmanned and manned Duna orbiting, landing and returning)
-Kaphrodite, 6 missions (Unmanned and manned Eve orbiting, landing and returning)
-Kera, 4 missions (Unmanned and manned Jool orbiting, landing and returning)
-Kermes, 6 missions (Unmanned and manned Dres orbiting, landing and returning)
-Kephaestus, 6 missions (Unmanned and manned Moho orbiting, landing and returning)
-Kades, 6 missions (Unmanned and manned Eeloo orbiting, landing and returning)



Prospective additions include:

-Interlunatary (same scope as the Interplanetary package, but for all non-Kerbin moons)
-K-Plane (based on historical X-Plane program)
-Reusable Launch Platform (based on historical shuttle program)
-Orbital Infrastructure (space stations, all planetary bodies)
-Surface Infrastructure (surface stations, all planetary bodies)
-Mining Operations (leverage Kethane mod for both mining and refueling operations)
-Survival Mode (require Deadly Re-Entry and IonCross mods, disallow MechJeb mod)
