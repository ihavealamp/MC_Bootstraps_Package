Overview:

This is a project to create a series of mission packages for the Mission Controller Extended (MC) mod in conjunction with Kerbal Space Program (KSP). The goal is to provide a pathway for new players to learn the game - picking themselves up by their bootstraps - similar to how real life space programs developed. Much of the inspiration for this project came from the NASA and Soviet programs, condensing things where I felt necessary and providing a clean flow.

Also be aware that the mission goals are written with a procedural-heavy focus, calling out and requiring each individual step to be met for success. It will not be uncommon to come across missions with 10+ goals. Just a heads up in case that's not your thing.



Scope:

The current scope is limited to programs within Kerbal's sphere of influence (BSP-Kerbal SOI.mpkg), interplanetary programs (BSP-Interplanetary.mpkg), planetary/lunar orbital stations (BSP-Planet Orbitals.mpkg & BSP-Lunar Orbitals.mpkg), and planetary/lunar surface bases (BSP-Planet Bases.mpkg & BSP-Lunar Bases.mpkg). Including a high level overview of the programs within each package below.

Kerbal SOI, 34 missions

-Kercury, 4 missions (Basic launching, orbiting and landing)
-Kemini, 7 missions (Orbiting, EVA, rendezvous and docking)
-Kastor, 4 missions (Unmanned Mun orbiting, landing and returning)
-Kollux, 4 missions (Unmanned Minmus orbiting, landing and returning)
-Kapollo, 8 missions (Manned Mun orbiting, landing and returning)
-Kartemis, 7 missions (Manned Minmus orbiting, landing and returning)

Interplanetary, 34 missions

-Kares, 6 missions (Unmanned and manned Duna orbiting, landing and returning)
-Kaphrodite, 6 missions (Unmanned and manned Eve orbiting, landing and returning)
-Kera, 4 missions (Unmanned and manned Jool orbiting, landing and returning)
-Kermes, 6 missions (Unmanned and manned Dres orbiting, landing and returning)
-Kephaestus, 6 missions (Unmanned and manned Moho orbiting, landing and returning)
-Kades, 6 missions (Unmanned and manned Eeloo orbiting, landing and returning)

Planet Orbitals, 24 missions

-Fuel & Crew Support, 3 missions (Location indifferent, repeatable)
-Orbital Command Module, 7 missions (All planets)
-Orbital Core Modules, 7 missions (All planets, repeatable)
-Orbital Auxiliary Modules, 7 missions (All planets, repeatable)

Planet Bases, 24 missions

-Fuel & Crew Support, 3 missions (Location indifferent, repeatable)
-Surface Command Module, 7 missions (All planets)
-Surface Core Modules, 7 missions (All planets, repeatable)
-Surface Auxiliary Modules, 7 missions (All planets, repeatable)

Lunar Orbitals, 30 missions

-Fuel & Crew Support, 3 missions (Location indifferent, repeatable)
-Orbital Command Module, 9 missions (All moons)
-Orbital Core Modules, 9 missions (All moons, repeatable)
-Orbital Auxiliary Modules, 9 missions (All moons, repeatable)

Lunar Orbitals, 30 missions

-Fuel & Crew Support, 3 missions (Location indifferent, repeatable)
-Surface Command Module, 9 missions (All moons)
-Surface Core Modules, 9 missions (All moons, repeatable)
-Surface Auxiliary Modules, 9 missions (All moons, repeatable)

Grand Total, 176 missions



Installation/Usage:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of the Mission Controller Extended mod installed: http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43645-(KSP-22)-Mission-Controller-Extended-(Updated-Nov-6)-(BETA-36)
2. Copy all *.mpkg files within the downloaded MC_Bootstraps_Package directory into your GameData\MissionController\Plugins\PluginData\MissionController directory.
3. Launch the game.
4. Open the Mission Controller plugin once you're at the Space Center.
5. Select one of the "BSP" packages.
6. Select a mission.
7. Enjoy!
8. Feel free to report any issues or submit enhancement requests via GitHub: https://github.com/ihavealamp/MC_Bootstraps_Package/issues/new



Future Mission Packages:

Looking forward down the line, here are the prospective additions I have down so far.

-Interlunatary (same scope as the Interplanetary package, but for all non-Kerbin moons)
-K-Plane (based on historical X-Plane program)
-Reusable Launch Platform (based on historical shuttle program)
-Orbital Infrastructure (space stations, all planetary bodies)
-Surface Infrastructure (surface stations, all planetary bodies)
-Mining Operations (leverage Kethane mod for both mining and refueling operations)
-Survival Mode (require Deadly Re-Entry and IonCross mods, disallow MechJeb mod)



Roadmap/Schedule:

Short-Term Focus
-Test basic functionality for all missions
-Add basic descriptions for all goals

Mid-Term Focus
-Add full descriptions for all missions and goals
-Build additional mission packages

Long-Term Focus
-Gather feedback on mission rewards and fine-tune
-Transition mission rewards from mission completion to goal completion
